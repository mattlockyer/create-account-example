# For Create Account Example Flow

Steps:
1. generate seed phrase
2. create account with new accountId and new publicKey
3. redirects to wallet
4. on return check the account was created
5. use the secretKey from the credentials var created in step 1 to create a new account instance
6. deploy contract to the new account
7. user is in complete control and has a seed phrase as a recovery method
8. (optional) keep the new secretKey in localStorage so you can recreate the account instance, or prompt user for seed phrase when they want to access their contract




## Description

This contract implements simple counter backed by storage on blockchain.
Contract in `contract/src/lib.rs` provides methods to increment / decrement counter and get it's current value or reset.

Plus and minus buttons increase and decrease value correspondingly. When button L is toggled, a little light turns on, just for fun. RS button is for reset. LE and RE buttons to let the robot wink at you.

## To Run
Open in the Gitpod link above or clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/rust-counter
```


## Setup [Or skip to Login if in Gitpod](#login)
Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

If you don't have `Rust` installed, complete the following 3 steps:

1) Install Rustup by running:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

([Taken from official installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

2) Configure your current shell by running:

```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

3) Add wasm target to your toolchain by running:

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, make sure you have `near-cli` by running:

```
near --version
```

If you need to install `near-cli`:

```
npm install near-cli -g
```

## Login
If you do not have a NEAR account, please create one with [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org).

In the project root, login with `near-cli` by following the instructions after this command:

```
near login
```

Modify the top of `src/config.js`, changing the `CONTRACT_NAME` to be the NEAR account that was just used to log in.

```javascript
…
const CONTRACT_NAME = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE'; /* TODO: fill this in! */
…
```

Start the example!

```
yarn start
```

## To Test

```
cd contract
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
